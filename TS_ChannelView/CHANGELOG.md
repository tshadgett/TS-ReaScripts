# ChannelView — changelog

## 1.0.0 — first public release

Released under the MIT Licence. No change to behaviour from 0.1.0.

- Renamed onto the `TS_` convention: `ChannelView.lua` is now
  `TS_ChannelView.lua`, the modules are `TS_CV_*`, and the folder is
  `Scripts/TS_ChannelView/`.
- ExtState section `ChannelView` is now `TS_ChannelView`, for both the
  global settings and the per-project collapsed state. Window position and
  dock state reset once on first run after updating.
- The layout library and step cache are now
  `TS_ChannelView_Mappings.ini` and `TS_ChannelView_Steps.ini`. Existing
  files are carried over, including their saved probe entries.
- `CV_Test.lua` and `CV_Audit.py` moved into `dev/` and are no longer part
  of the installed set. Both now resolve their own paths, so they run from
  anywhere; the test harness's real-tag-file block reads
  `TS_CV_TEST_FXTAGS` and skips cleanly without it, rather than failing on
  a `realdata/` folder that no longer exists.
- Removed five unreferenced functions: `E.editing_key`, `T.get_offline`,
  `T.preset_name`, `M.is_dirty`, `SU.command_id`.
- Attribution reworded. StripLink is credited for the parameter-mapping
  idea and the layout file format only — no StripLink code is reproduced.
  RackLib, Plugin Rack and Docked Plugin Display are my own, and now say
  so. Nothing here derives from TK FX Browser or TK Workbench; that was
  checked line by line.
- Added this changelog.

## Before this

0.1.0 was the private working version.
